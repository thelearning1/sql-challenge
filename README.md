SQL Bootcamp Homework

The focus of the task is establishing a basic database in SQL, and performing queries within it. 

#### Data Engineering

* Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 

#### Data Analysis

Once you have a complete database, do the following:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

## Bonus (Optional)

1. Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas, but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) This step may require some research. Feel free to use the code below to get started. Be sure to make any necessary modifications for your username, password, host, port, and database name:

   ```sql
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   engine = create_engine('postgresql://localhost:5432/<your_db_name>')
   connection = engine.connect()
   ```

2. Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.

3. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.


## Submission

* Create an image file of your ERD.

* Create a `.sql` file of your table schemata.

* Create a `.sql` file of your queries.

* (Optional) Create a Jupyter Notebook of the bonus analysis.

* Create and upload a repository with the above files to GitHub and post a link on BootCamp Spot.

* Ensure your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file
